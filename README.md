# Automated-Attendance-System-for-Rural-Schools
An offline, lightweight QR-based Attendance System designed for rural schools. Teachers scan student QR codes within a set timer (e.g., 15 mins); absentees are auto-marked. Data is stored locally, exported as CSV, and visualized with charts. Built with HTML, CSS, JSâ€”optimized for low-end devices.
